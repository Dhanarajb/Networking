# How the Internet Works (Data Flow from Global ISP to User)

The internet is a huge network that connects computers and devices all over the world. It allows us to send and receive information, like browsing websites, watching videos, and sending emails. The internet works through different networks that pass information from one to another until it reaches you. Here's how it works:

## **What is the Internet?**

The **Internet** is a global system that connects millions of computers and devices, letting them share information. It works using special rules (called protocols) to make sure data gets sent and received properly.

## **How Data Travels from Global ISP to User**:

1. **Global ISP**:
    - When you want to visit a website, the request starts with the **Global ISP**. These ISPs manage large networks that connect different countries and regions. 
    - **Example**: The Global ISP could be a big company that owns the cables that connect continents.

2. **Regional ISP**:
    - Next, the request goes to a **Regional ISP** that works in your country or region. This ISP helps route the data to the right area.
    - **Example**: A Regional ISP serves a specific country or large city.

3. **Local ISP**:
    - The **Regional ISP** then sends the request to a **Local ISP**, which connects to homes or businesses in a smaller area, like a neighborhood or city.
    - **Example**: Your home or business might be connected to the internet through a Local ISP.

4. **User**:
    - Finally, the request reaches you, the **User**, through your Local ISP. The Local ISP then brings back the website or information you asked for, and you can see it on your screen.
    - **Example**: When you search for something on Google, the data travels through all these steps and shows up on your device.
