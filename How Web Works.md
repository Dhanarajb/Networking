# How the Browser Renders a Webpage

1. **Enter a URL**
   - When you enter a URL in the browser, such as `https://www.example.com`, the browser starts by breaking down the URL into components:
     - **Protocol**: `https` (for secure communication)
     - **Domain Name**: `example.com` (human-readable address)
     - **Path**: `/` (specific resource, like a webpage or file)

2. **Domain Name System (DNS)**
   - The browser sends the domain name (`example.com`) to a DNS server, which acts like a phonebook to translate the domain into an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). This IP address identifies the web server hosting the website.

3. **Connecting to the Server**
   - Using the IP address, the browser connects to the web server via the Internet, using the **TCP/IP** protocol. If the protocol is **HTTPS**, a secure connection is established using **SSL/TLS encryption**.

4. **Sending a Request**
   - The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, such as `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`. This request includes:
     - **Headers**: Metadata (like the browser type, accepted file formats).
     - **Body**: Data sent to the server (in case of a POST request).

5. **Server Processes the Request**
   - The web server processes the request:
     - For static files (like images), it sends the file directly.
     - For dynamic content (like user data), it might query a database or perform logic.

6. **Server Sends a Response**
   - The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser with:
     - **Status Code**: Indicates whether the request was successful (e.g., `200 OK`) or failed (e.g., `404 Not Found`).
     - **Headers**: Metadata about the response.
     - **Body**: The requested content (e.g., an HTML page).

7. **Loading and Parsing the Content**
   - The browser loads and parses resources to render the webpage:
     - **Fetch Resources**: Downloads HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets.
     - **HTML Parsing**: Reads the HTML and constructs the **DOM** (Document Object Model).
     - **CSS Parsing**: Downloads and parses **CSS** to build the **CSSOM** (CSS Object Model).
     - **JavaScript Execution**: JavaScript modifies the DOM and CSSOM. The browser may pause HTML parsing to execute synchronous scripts.

8. **Rendering the Page**
   - The browser converts the DOM and CSSOM into pixels on the screen:
     - **Style Calculation**: Computes the final styles for elements.
     - **Layout (Reflow)**: Determines the size and position of elements on the page.
     - **Render Tree**: Merges the DOM and CSSOM to represent visual elements.
     - **Painting**: Converts the render tree into a visual output and displays the webpage on the screen.
