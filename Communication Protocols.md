# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

## What is HTTP?

- **Definition**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol used to transfer data such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other web resources between a client (browser) and a server.
- **Type**: It is a stateless, application-layer protocol.
- **Port**: HTTP typically operates on **port 80**.
- **Protocol Version**: Common versions include:
  - **HTTP/1.1**: Most widely used with persistent connections.
  - **HTTP/2**: Introduced multiplexing and compression.
  - **HTTP/3**: Uses UDP with enhanced speed and security.

## Why is HTTP Important?

1. **Foundation of the Web**: HTTP powers the web, enabling browsers to communicate with servers seamlessly.
2. **Platform Independent**: It works universally across devices and operating systems.
3. **Ease of Use**: Provides a simple structure for exchanging requests and responses.
4. **Supports Caching**: Improves performance by allowing resources to be reused.
5. **Flexibility in Methods**:
   - **GET**: Retrieve data (e.g., fetching a webpage).
   - **POST**: Send data to the server (e.g., submitting a form).
   - **PUT**: Update data on the server.
   - **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

## When is HTTP Used?

- **Accessing Websites**: Anytime you type a URL (e.g., `http://example.com`) in your browser.
- **RESTful APIs**: HTTP is widely used in API communication to exchange data between systems.
- **File Downloads**: HTTP allows files such as PDFs, images, or documents to be downloaded from the server.
- **Sending Form Data**: Login, registration, or any form submission involves HTTP.

## Where Does HTTP Operate?

- **Browser to Web Server**: Facilitates communication between a userâ€™s browser and a web application.
- **Application to Application**: Used for data transfer between APIs.
- **Local Development**: Developers use HTTP servers for testing and debugging locally.

## How HTTP Works

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **DNS Resolution**:
   - The client (browser) converts the domain name (e.g., `example.com`) into an IP address using DNS.
2. **TCP Handshake**:
   - A reliable connection is established between the client and server using the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**.
3. **Client Sends Request**:
   - The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying:
     - HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
     - Target resource (e.g., `/home`).
4. **Server Processes Request**:
   - The server interprets the request, retrieves the required resource, and sends back an HTTP response.
5. **Client Receives Response**:
   - The browser renders the received data (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to display the requested page.

## Scenario: Visiting a Website Using HTTP

### Real-Life Example

You open your browser and type `http://example.com` into the address bar.

1. **Request**:
   - The browser sends an HTTP `GET` request to the server asking for the homepage.
2. **Response**:
   - The server processes the request and sends back the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed for the homepage.
3. **Rendering**:
   - The browser displays the website using the received data.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Stateless Nature**:
  - HTTP does not retain memory of previous requests or interactions.
- **Request Methods in Action**:
  - `GET`: To fetch the homepage.
  - `POST`: To submit data (e.g., login details).
